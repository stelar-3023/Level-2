      What are you doing hiding there? It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't
      deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning, kept
      babbling on about his mission. Oh, no! That R2 unit has always been a
      problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't
      understand their logic at times. How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in
      sight. Blast it! Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him? It's too
      dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until
      morning. Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night. All right, I'll
      be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it. You know that little
      droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble. Oh, he excels at that, sir.
      Wake up! Wake up! We're doomed. Do you think they'll melt us down? Don't
      shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a
      translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. It looks like we don't have much of
      a choice but I'll remind him. I have no need for a protocol droid. Sir --
      not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed
      for over thirty secondary functions that... What I really need is a droid
      that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. Vaporators!
      Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter...very similar to
      your vaporators. You could say... Do you speak Bocce? Of course I can,
      sir. It's like a second language for me...I'm as fluent in... All right
      shut up! I'll take this one.
